# Bash Cheatsheet
## Navigating
pwd                       # Print current directory path
ls                        # List directories
stat foo.txt              # List size, created and modified timestamps for a file
stat foo                  # List size, created and modified timestamps for a directory
tree                      # List directory and file tree
tree -d                   # List directory tree
cd foo                    # Go to foo sub-directory
cd                        # Go to home directory
cd ~                      # Go to home directory
cd -                      # Go to last directory

## Making Directory
mkdir foo                        # Create a directory

## Deleting Directory
rmdir foo                        # Delete non-empty directory

## File Management
cp foo.txt bar.txt                                # Copy file
mv foo.txt bar.txt                                # Move file
rm foo.txt                                        # Delete file
cat foo.txt            # Print all contents
head foo.txt           # Print top 10 lines of file
tail foo.txt           # Print bottom 10 lines of file
open foo.txt           # Open file in the default editor
wc foo.txt             # List number of lines words and characters in the file
